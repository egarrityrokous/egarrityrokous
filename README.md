My name is Eamon Garrity-Rokous, and I'm currently a first-year at Williams College on the varsity wrestling team planning on double-majoring in Computer Science and Economics.
I'm involved in startups, fintech, cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and venture capital.
I'm proficient in Python, Java, and SQL.
I'm looking to collaborate with others in the startup, VC, and business world and work with passionate people on projects and businesses we're excited about working on every morning we wake up.
