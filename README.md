My name is Eamon Garrity-Rokous, and I'm currently a first-year at Williams College on the varsity wrestling team majoring in Computer Science.
I'm interested in startups, fintech, cryptocurrencies, blockchain, venture capital, and anything and everything cutting-edge.
I'm currently learning Python and algorithmic coding, recursion, and machine learning.
I'm looking to collaborate with others in the startup, VC, and business world and work with passionate people on projects and businesses we're excited about working on every morning we wake up.
